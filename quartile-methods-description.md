Create a new object called `Stats` that has three methods:

<ul>
<li>`Stats.median`</li>
<li>`Stats.lowerQuartile`</li>
<li>`Stats.upperQuartile`</li>
</ul>

`median` should return the number at the midpoint in a sorted array. `lowerQuartile` should return the number one quarter of the way through the array. `upperQuartile` should return the number three quarters of the way through the array. When a cut-off point is between two numbers, take the average of the numbers on either side. Round your answer to a maximum of two decimal places.

All inputs will be valid arrays of numbers.
